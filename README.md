# ðŸ“Œ Lung Cancer Mortality Classifier Model

This project explores a dataset of lung cancer patients with the goal of predicting patient mortality.  
By applying machine learning techniques, I aim to identify key factors that influence survival outcomes and develop a model capable of accurately classifying mortality risk.
